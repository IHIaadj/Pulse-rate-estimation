    "This implementation estimates the pulse rate from the PPG signal and a 3-axis accelerometer. The ground truth pulse rate is taken from ECG signals. The code produces an output every 2 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Function descriptions: \n",
    "* *LoadTroikaDataset* returns two objects: \n",
    "    * data_fls which contains a list of all files with a name starting with 'DATA_' in the directory\n",
    "    * ref_fls which contains a list of all files with a name starting with 'REF_' in the directory\n",
    "* *LoadTroikaDataFile* extracts the signal in the form of a numpy array with PPG and 3-axis accelerometer measurements.\n",
    "* *Evaluate* is global function that loads the dataset, run the pulse rate algorithm (RunPulseRateAlgorithm) and aggregate the evaluation metrics. \n",
    "* *RunPulseRateAlgorithm* this function is the heart of the algorithm: \n",
    "    * It first ensures that the signal is band passed through a 40BPM to 240BPM filter. \n",
    "    * Next, characteristic frequencies for each signal are calculated in 8 second windows with 6 second overlap between adjacent windows. Characteristic frequencies for the PPG data are compared against the highest characteristic frequencies for each accelerometer axis per time window. This comparison determines the pulse rate frequency. When all frequencies extracted are similar to the accelerometer frequencies, the largest frequency is returned. \n",
    "    * Converts the frequency to beats per minute\n",
    "    * Compute the confidence \n",
    "    * Finally, the absolute error between the determined pulse rate and the reference ECG pulse rate data are calculated. The errors and confidences are returned from this function\n",

    "2. **Data Description** \n",
    "\n",
    "The Troika dataset is used to build the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-channel PPG signals, 3-axis accelerometer signals, and one-channel ECG signals were simultaneously recorded. All signals were sampled at fs = 125Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is collected on 12 different subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The signal data are contained in files named 'DATA_XX_TYPEXX'. Each file has 6 rows: Row1 ECG data, Rows 2 and 3 are the two channels of PPG; and Rows 4,5, and 6 are the x-, y-, and z-axis accelerometer measurements. The ground truth data is contained in files named 'REF_XX_TYPEXX'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm Description** \n",
    "\n",
    "This method estimates pulse rate using data from Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors worn on the user's wrist. PPG sensors send light into a user's wrist and measure the quantity of light that returns to the PPG's photodector. The quantity of blood cells in one region is the physiological aspect that a PPG monitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the heart contracts, blood fills the extremities and thus more blood cells are measured by the sensor.\n",
    "* When the heart relaxes, blood leaves the extremities and fill the heart --> less blood cells are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving the arm when walking or running may interfere with the measurements as the blood cell movement changes. \n",
    "The outputs of the algorithm are: \n",
    "* The estimated pulse rate frequency (in BPM) \n",
    "* The confidence score of that prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks of using this algorithm: \n",
    "* The output from this algorithm only takes into account arm movement noise that is periodic.\n",
    "* It does not handle non-periodic movements captured by sensors.\n",
    "* Does not account for other noise sources such as ambient light or shifts in sensor position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major issue with this algorithm is the amount of data it is trained on. Note that using machine learning algorithm such random forest regression may increase its performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Algorithm Performance** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance was calculated by calculating the mean absolute error between the estimated pulse rate frequency and the groud truth extracted from REF files. This algorithm meets the project's requirement that the mean absolute error at 90% availability is less than 15 BPM on the test dataset.\n",
